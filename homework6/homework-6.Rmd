## Tree-Based Models

For this assignment, we will continue working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

**Note: Fitting ensemble tree-based models can take a little while to run. Consider running your models outside of the .Rmd, storing the results, and loading them in your .Rmd to minimize time to knit.**

### Exercise 1

Read in the data and set things up as in Homework 5:

-   Use `clean_names()`
-   Filter out the rarer Pokémon types
-   Convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors\

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(janitor)
library(corrplot)
library(rpart.plot)
library(randomForest)
library(ranger)
library(vip)
tidymodels_prefer()

set.seed(1234)

pokemon <- read_csv('data/pokemon.csv') %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(type_1 %in% c('Bug', 'Fire', 'Grass', 'Normal', 'Water', 'Psychic'))

pokemon$type_1 <- as.factor(pokemon$type_1)
pokemon$legendary <- as.factor(pokemon$legendary)
```

Do an initial split of the data; you can choose the percentage for splitting. Stratify on the outcome variable.

```{r}
pokemon_split <- initial_split(pokemon, strata=type_1)
pokemon_train <- training(pokemon_split)
pokemon_test <- testing(pokemon_split)
```

Fold the training set using *v*-fold cross-validation, with `v = 5`. Stratify on the outcome variable.

```{r}
pokemon_folds <- vfold_cv(pokemon_train, v=5, strata=type_1)
```

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`:

-   Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;
-   Center and scale all predictors.

```{r}
pokemon_rec <- pokemon_train %>% 
  recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp + sp_def) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% # Step Dummy
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) # Center AND Scale
```

### Exercise 2

Create a correlation matrix of the training set, using the `corrplot` package. *Note: You can choose how to handle the continuous variables for this plot; justify your decision(s).*

```{r}
corr_df <- pokemon_train %>%
  select(-c(number, generation, total)) # Removing continuous variables

cor(select_if(corr_df, is.numeric), use='pairwise.complete.obs') %>%
  corrplot() # Creating correlation matrix
```

What relationships, if any, do you notice? Do these relationships make sense to you?

*It should be noted that alongside the non-numeric values,* `number` *and* `generation` *have also been removed as they represent the continuous values and creating a correlation matrix provides no information, as they are continuous.*

*These relationships all make sense, as they are highly correlated values which all have a positive relationship. The strongest relationships exist between* `sp_def` *and* `defense` *as well as* `sp_atk`. *The lack of negative correlations is interesting, as it means each of these values likely always has a positive relationship with the other values.*

### Exercise 3

First, set up a decision tree model and workflow. Tune the `cost_complexity` hyperparameter. Use the same levels we used in Lab 7 -- that is, `range = c(-3, -1)`. Specify that the metric we want to optimize is `roc_auc`.

```{r}
tree_spec <- decision_tree(cost_complexity=tune()) %>%
  set_mode('classification') %>%
  set_engine('rpart')

poke_tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(tree_spec) %>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_rec)

cost_grid <- grid_regular(
  cost_complexity(range=c(-3, -1)), levels=10
)

dec_tune_res <- tune_grid(
  poke_tree_wf,
  resamples=pokemon_folds,
  grid=cost_grid,
  metrics=metric_set(yardstick::roc_auc)
)
```

Print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? Does a single decision tree perform better with a smaller or larger complexity penalty?

```{r}
autoplot(dec_tune_res)
```

### Exercise 4

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing pruned decision tree on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
dec_tune_res %>%
  collect_metrics() %>%
  arrange(-mean)
```

*The* `roc_auc` *of the best-performing pruned decision tree is 0.6338273.*

### Exercise 5

Using `rpart.plot`, fit and visualize your best-performing pruned decision tree with the *training* set.

```{r}
best_complexity <- select_best(dec_tune_res)

poke_tree_final <- finalize_workflow(poke_tree_wf, best_complexity)

poke_tree_final_fit <- fit(poke_tree_final, pokemon_train)

poke_tree_final_fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine() %>%
  rpart.plot()
```

### Exercise 5

Now set up a random forest model and workflow. Use the `ranger` engine and set `importance = "impurity"`. Tune `mtry`, `trees`, and `min_n`. Using the documentation for `rand_forest()`, explain in your own words what each of these hyperparameters represent.

```{r}
randomfor_spec <- rand_forest(mtry=tune(), trees=tune(), min_n=tune()) %>%
  set_engine("ranger", importance='impurity') %>%
  set_mode("classification")

randomfor_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(randomfor_spec) %>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_rec)
```

-   `mtry` *represents the number of integers which will be used in creating each random split*

-   `trees` *is there number of separate trees which will be tested to find the best overall model*

-   `min_n` *is the minimum number of data points that will be required for a node to be split further*

Create a regular grid with 8 levels each. You can choose plausible ranges for each hyperparameter. Note that `mtry` should not be smaller than 1 or larger than 8. **Explain why not. What type of model would `mtry = 8` represent?**

```{r}
randomfor_grid <- grid_regular(
  mtry(range = c(1, 8)), trees(range = c(10, 2000)),
  min_n(range = c(10, 90)),
  levels = 8
)
```

*A model with* `mtry=8` *would be a model which used all of the predictors to determine what will be randomly sampled at each split, thus it is the maximum number of predictors which could be used since there are only 8 predictors. It can not be smaller than that for the same reason, if it is 0, there will be no predictors to create a model on.*

### Exercise 6

Specify `roc_auc` as a metric. Tune the model and print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? What values of the hyperparameters seem to yield the best performance?

```{r}
rand_tune_res <- tune_grid(
  randomfor_wf,
  resamples=pokemon_folds,
  randomfor_grid,
  metrics=metric_set(yardstick::roc_auc)
)
```

```{r}
autoplot(rand_tune_res)
```

*Each hyper-value has several well performing values, but each only has one that performs the best in each test. For* `mtry` *two and four perform the best overall. The best value for* `trees` *seems to lie between 750 and 1250 in this case. The minimal node size* `min_n` *tends to be best with a value lower than 15.*

### Exercise 7

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing random forest model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
rand_tune_res %>%
  collect_metrics() %>%
  arrange(-mean)
```

*The* `roc_auc` *of the best performing model is 0.7212131*

### Exercise 8

Create a variable importance plot, using `vip()`, with your best-performing random forest model fit on the *training* set.

```{r}
best_model <- select_best(rand_tune_res)

poke_rf_final <- finalize_workflow(randomfor_wf, best_model)

poke_rf_final_fit <- fit(poke_rf_final, pokemon_train) %>% extract_fit_parsnip()

vip(poke_rf_final_fit)
```

Which variables were most useful? Which were least useful? Are these results what you expected, or not?

*The most useful variables were* `sp_atk` *and* `attack`*, with most of the others not far behind. The least useful were* `generation` *and* `legendary`*. These results are not unexpected, but I was not sure which variables would be most useful. Having* `generation` *and* `legendary` *be the least useful makes a lot of sense, as these variables are generally not representative of type at all from memory.*

### Exercise 9

Finally, set up a boosted tree model and workflow. Use the `xgboost` engine. Tune `trees`. Create a regular grid with 10 levels; let `trees` range from 10 to 2000. Specify `roc_auc` and again print an `autoplot()` of the results.

```{r}
boost_spec <- boost_tree(trees=tune()) %>%
  set_engine('xgboost') %>%
  set_mode('classification')

poke_boost_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(boost_spec) %>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_rec)

trees_grid <- grid_regular(
  trees(range=c(10, 2000)), levels=10
)

boost_tune_res <- tune_grid(
  poke_boost_wf,
  resamples=pokemon_folds,
  grid=trees_grid,
  metrics=metric_set(yardstick::roc_auc)
)

autoplot(boost_tune_res)
```

What do you observe?

*The best value for trees is between about 100 and 250.*

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing boosted tree model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
boost_tune_res %>%
  collect_metrics() %>%
  arrange(-mean)
```

*The* `roc_auc` *of the best performing model is 0.6863787*.

### Exercise 10

Display a table of the three ROC AUC values for your best-performing pruned tree, random forest, and boosted tree models. Which performed best on the folds? Select the best of the three and use `select_best()`, `finalize_workflow()`, and `fit()` to fit it to the *testing* set.

```{r}
dec_best <- dec_tune_res %>%
  collect_metrics() %>%
  arrange(-mean) %>%
  head(1) %>%
  select(mean)

rand_best <- rand_tune_res %>%
  collect_metrics() %>%
  arrange(-mean) %>%
  head(1) %>%
  select(mean)

boost_best <- boost_tune_res %>%
  collect_metrics() %>%
  arrange(-mean) %>%
  head(1) %>%
  select(mean)

roc_auc <- data.frame('decision' = dec_best$mean, 
                      'random_forest' = rand_best$mean, 
                      'boosted' = boost_best$mean)
roc_auc
```

*Thus the best performing model in this case is the random forest tree.*

```{r}
rand_best <- select_best(rand_tune_res)
poke_rf_final <- finalize_workflow(randomfor_wf, rand_best)
poke_test_fit <- fit(poke_rf_final, pokemon_test)
```

Print the AUC value of your best-performing model on the testing set. Print the ROC curves. Finally, create and visualize a confusion matrix heat map.

```{r}
test_results <- augment(poke_test_fit, new_data = pokemon_test)

test_results %>%
  roc_auc(type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water)
```

```{r}
test_results %>%
  roc_curve(type_1, .pred_Bug:.pred_Water) %>%
  autoplot()
```

```{r}
test_results %>%
  conf_mat(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class) %>%
  autoplot(type = 'heatmap')
```

Which classes was your model most accurate at predicting? Which was it worst at?

*They all performed almost perfectly with the exception of Grass which was wrongly classified once as a Fire type.*

### Exercise 11

Using the `abalone.txt` data from previous assignments, fit and tune a random forest model to predict `age`. Use stratified cross-validation and select ranges for `mtry`, `min_n`, and `trees`. Present your results. What was the model's RMSE on your testing set?
