### Machine Learning Main Ideaas

#### Question 1:
*Define supervised and unsupervised learning. What are the difference(s) between them?*

**Supervised learning**: involves a statistical model built for predicting an output based on predictor(s). 

**Unsupervised learning**: involves an inputs without the help of a supervising output, meaning the relationships and structure come from the data.

The difference is the existence of an output, or a training set, which can be used to determine the accuracy of the models.

#### Question 2:
*Explain the difference between a regression model and a classification model, specifically in the context of machine learning.*
